          <h3>What it's about?</h3>
          <p>This website was created for people who love reading with a passion. This book diary allows people to note down every single book that they've read but what they can also do is add notes on whether they liked the book or whether they disliked it. Adding in notes to each individual book allows a person to go back and reflect on how they felt about a certain book.</p>
